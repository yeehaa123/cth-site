  layout: quote 
  slide-content: 
    markdown: |
      The quality that makes you go to great effort to *reduce overall energy 
      expenditure*. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people 
      will find useful, and *document* what you wrote so you don't have to answer 
      so many questions about it. 

      ~ Larry Wall

- title: Impatience
  layout: quote 
  slide-content: 
    markdown: |
      The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write 
      programs that don't just react to your *needs*, but actually *anticipate* 
      them. Or at least pretend to.

      Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.
