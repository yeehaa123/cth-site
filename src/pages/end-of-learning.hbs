      The quality that makes you go to great effort to *reduce overall energy 
      expenditure*. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people 
      will find useful, and *document* what you wrote so you don't have to answer 
      so many questions about it.

- title: Impatience
  layout: quote 
  slide-content: 
    markdown: |
      The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write 
      programs that don't just react to your *needs*, but actually *anticipate* 
      them. Or at least pretend to.
