[Coding the Humanities](http://www.codingthehumanities.com) is the title of a pioneering course which will familiarize humanities students with basic programming skills over the period of a month (starting June 2). This highly intensive, yet enjoyable experimental crash course not only aims at providing students a hands-on experience of coding and exploring an online workplace, but also aspires to introduce a new, practical-oriented model of research through programming, where researchers are free to develop and apply their own tools. The course allows students to investigate digital data from the perspective of the humanities.

Contrary to the bias against technology that is still dominant in academic circles, and to the conviction that certain disciplines are –or should– be excluded from the digital world, Coding the Humanities implements new unlimited practices of digital literacy, while challenging situated knowledge. By the end of the course, students will have reached an intermediate level of the latest standards in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, be able to develop browser-based widgets and be able to develop tools for humanities’ research. This enables students to translate complex theoretical problems into smaller, practical projects. As such, the pilot is part of a larger move to create an eHumanities lab at the UvA.
        
The course is open to bachelor, master and PhD students of different fields and academic backgrounds. No prior experience in coding is needed. The lessons and exercises will be in English. The students will be called to work on diverse exercises, such as developing interfaces, interactive pieces, data visualization et al, and the ones who will successfully complete the course will be granted 6 ECTS.
        
It is required from participants to work together in small peer-groups in the space of the lab, which will be open from 08:30 to 20:30 (working days) with the assistance of supervisors. During the four week course, a number of (inter)national speakers, from both public institutes as well as private companies, will give lectures and work together with the students. In the final week, students will present their work during an organized event. The number of participants will be strictly limited to 20 people. Interested students can register online by May 27. The selection process will be finalized by the end of May.
