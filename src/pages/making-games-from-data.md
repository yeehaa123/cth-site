## Making Games from Data

"We want to take quantitative data and turn our papers into computer games that convey the theory," sounded the conclusion of the last presentation on last week's Coding the Humanities opening event. 

But how can we turn theory into quantitative data? And what do you need to make a computer game? This week, we turned from the smaller group projects of week one to a large, collaborative project and started making a game. 

### Translating Data into Different Guises

During the first half of the week, Marijn, Jan Hein and Alexandro Mancusi from [Weyeser](http://weyeser.com/) gave introductions to API's, data sets, user stories, Json, Rest, Git and Firebase after which the students explored the tools themselves. 

On Thursday, after a few days of technological immersion, Federico Bonelli of [Trasformatorio](http://www.trasformatorio.net/) reintroduced theory into data science and presented his work and ideas on interdisciplinary, truth and poetic terrorism. He showed how data can be translated and transformed into different guises. 

### Presenting Complex Issues

On Thursday evening, during the weekly open event, the students presented their collective work. They created a visualisation using mock data via Firebase, which they'd collected using a Facebook authentication system, and used words such as "two way data binding" without flinching. That's how far they've come already!

After the presentation, there was extensive room for feedback. We talked about how you present an issue in a clear manner, without hiding what complex questions this issue brings to the fore when you explore it. 

### Pitching your Ideas

Friday started with an impromptu lecture in project management by [Nigel Hamlin](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/nigelhamlin
). We worked on practical project management skills and worked on preparing a five minute pitch for the project. Next week, we'll film the pitch and make it available on the website.

We ended the week with a pair programming session after which the students were invited to do some live coding. And this amazing week ended even better with the amazing Dutch victory at their first World Cup game!
