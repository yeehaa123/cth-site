## From Building to Testing

Is it possible to build a viable MVP in 2,5 weeks without any prior programming experience? Yes, it is, the pilot group of Coding the Humanities proved this week.

### Learning the Basics

The week started with a lecture on JavaScript fundamentals, where the students learned the ins and outs of variables, loops, functions and scope, as well as some tips and tricks on how to debug their code. Jan Hein did a few pair programming sessions with students to demonstrate the importance communication and collaboration in programming. 

With these new skills they could jump the last hurdles of their projects. When we left on Tuesday evening, the hurdles still seemed quite big, yet on Wednesday morning everything suddenly clicked! With the house metaphor project finished, a short video was made to present their first product.

### Testing your Basics

This week, [Ashley Williams](http://heyashleyashley.com/) of [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com/), an Open Web development group in Boston, joined the Coding the Humanities project for a few workshops about learning programming. Just as the students (and most of the teachers) in the pilot, Ashley comes from a humanities background. The students worked through several assignments with her on test-driven development and modelling [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

### To Program is to Master Abstraction

The weekly open event on Thursday started with a presentation of the project the students had finished earlier in the week, which spontaneously evolved in a long presentation and discussion of their new project which aims to tie the Dutch open government data sets into their previous project exploring the house metaphor.

After the break, Ashley Williams talked about abstraction being one of the main hurdles to learning programming. She argued that lower-level languages can be easier to learn because they abstract away fewer things and are more explicit. 

On Friday Lex Slaghuis and Arjan El Fassed of the [Open State Foundation](http://openstate.eu/) presented the many projects they run on hacking open government data.
